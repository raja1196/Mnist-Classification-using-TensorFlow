# Mnist-Classification-using-TensorFlow

This project Executes Mnist digit classification (0-9) using tensorflow. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview/) is an effective machine learning tool that is utilized here. Although [keras](https://keras.io/) is simpler to understand, tensorflow is observed to be a more powerful tool. 


## Required dependencies

### Tensorflow
TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha is available
* tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0 —Preview TF 2.0 Alpha build for CPU-only (unstable)
* tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-alpha0 —Preview TF 2.0 Alpha build with GPU support (unstable, Ubuntu and Windows)
### Available packages
* tensorflow —Latest stable release for CPU-only (Ubuntu and Windows)
* tensorflow-gpu —Latest stable release with GPU support (Ubuntu and Windows)
* tf-nightly —Preview nightly build for CPU-only (unstable)
* tf-nightly-gpu —Preview nightly build with GPU support (unstable, Ubuntu and Windows)
### System requirements
* Ubuntu 16.04 or later (64-bit)
* macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (64-bit) (no GPU support)
* Windows 7 or later (64-bit) (Python 3 only)
* Raspbian 9.0 or later

```

### Installing

For installing Tensorflow, follow the directions mentioned in the link above. 


## Running the tests

To run the code, First initialize the virtual environment used to install tensorflow, and run the code either from the command prompt directly( Recommended for GPU users ) or any IDE.

If no error is observed, we can see an output like this.
